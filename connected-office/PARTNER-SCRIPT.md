# Connected Office Demo

## Overview

This section should include an overview of the importance of this demo and the
overall vision of what the demo is trying to accomplish from a partner's
perspective.

### Why DataStax Enterprise

It would be ideal to include information on why DataStax Enterprise is the
ideal choice for this application, but DataStax will have an additional script
focused around these DataStax-centric talking points. This allows this partner
script to focus more on selling the partner's application instead of the use of
DataStax Enterprise.

### Intended Audiences

* Pre-sales
* Post-sales
* Marketing
* Partners

### Intended Market Verticals

* Retail
* Manufacturing
* Inventory

## Script

This demo covers what life would be like in a near-future fully-connected
office where sensors would collect time-series data to show real-time updates
to a web/mobile app as well as perform near real-time analytics that benefit
cost reductions.

The first tab in the connected office demo covers real-time environment
sensors. Here you can see the temperature over time as well as the real-time
readings of our DataStax HQ conference rooms...
