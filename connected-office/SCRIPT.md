## Script

This demo covers what life would be like in a near-future fully-connected
office where sensors would collect time-series data to show real-time updates
to a web/mobile app as well as perform near real-time analytics that benefit
cost reductions.

The first tab in the connected office demo covers real-time environment
sensors. Here you can see the temperature over time as well as the real-time
readings of our DataStax HQ conference rooms...
